    "A function $f: \\mathbf{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ is *convex* if **dom** $f$ is a convex set and if for all $x$, $y \\in \\mathbf{dom}f$, and $\\theta$ with $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 1$, we have\n",

    "this inequality is known as **jensen's inequality**.\n",
    "\n",
    "this inequality means that the line segment bbetween (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)), which is the *chord* from $x$ to $y$, lies above the graph of $f$.\n",

    "### Extended-value extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "we can also embed the domain of our problem inside our convex function like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{f}(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "{f(x)} & {x \\in \\operatorname{dom} f} \\\\\n",

    "this essentially say that if a point violates the domain then set it to infinity which will make this problem essentially infeasable for these points.\n",
    "\n",
    "we will say more about these kinds of techniques, later in the next chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First-order conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "apart from jensen's inequality, we can check wether a function is convex or not using its gradient information ( if the function is differnetiable that is..). one such techinique which uses first-order derivative is (which can be though of as a *global underestimator* of the function $f$) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(y) \\geq f(x) + \\nabla f(x)^T(y-x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "this inequaltiy shows that from local information about a convex funtion we can derive global information. this property exmplains some of th remarkable properties of convex functions for example, this inequlatiy shows that if $\\nabla f(x) =0$, then for all $y \\in \\mathbf{dom}f$, $x$ is a global minimizer of the function $f$ \n",
    "\n",
    "we can also check for concavity by using \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(y) \\leq f(x) + \\nabla f(x)^T(y-x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and ofcourse, by using strict $>$ or $<$ we can check for strict convexity or strict concavity of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### second-order conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "we can also use the second-order derivative to check wether a function is convex or not although this can be hard to compute for higher-dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 0 \\preceq  \\nabla^2 f(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "the book gives alot of examples of functions that are convex or not, but as some professors have mentioned earlier, the best way to consume that is to practice the exercise, prove that a function is convex using the above conditions and develop the intution along the way. so we will skip the examples for now, but if you want them you can check pgno. 71 to 75.\n",

    "Evidently if $f$ is a convex function and $\\alpha \\geq 0,$ then the function $\\alpha f$ is convex.
