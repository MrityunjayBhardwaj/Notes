The term dual feasible, to describe a pair $(\\lambda, \\nu)$ with $\\lambda \\succeq 0$ and $g(\\lambda, \\nu)>-\\infty$ now makes sense.

    "\n",
    "The weak duality inequality (5.23) holds when $d^{*}$ and $p^{*}$ are infinite. For example, if the primal problem is unbounded below, so that $p^{*}=-\\infty,$ we must have $d^{*}=-\\infty,$ i.e., the Lagrange dual problem is infeasible. Conversely, if the dual problem is unbounded above, so that $d^{*}=\\infty,$ we must have $p^{\\star}=\\infty,$ i.e., the primal problem is infeasible.\n",
    "226\n",
    "We refer to the difference $p^{*}-d^{*}$ as the optimal duality gap of the original problem, since it gives the gap between the optimal value of the primal problem and the best (i.e., greatest) lower bound on it that can be obtained from the Lagrange dual function. The optimal duality gap is always nonnegative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bound (5.23) can sometimes be used to find a lower bound on the optimal value of a problem that is difficult to solve, since the dual problem is always convex, and in many cases can be solved efficiently, to find $d^{*}$. As an example, consider the two-way partitioning problem (5.7) described on page 219. The dual problem\n",

    "subject to $\\quad W+\\operatorname{diag}(\\nu) \\succeq 0$\n",
    "with variable $\\nu \\in \\mathbf{R}^{n} .$ This problem can be solved efficiently, even for relatively large values of $n,$ such as $n=1000 .$ Its optimal value is a lower bound on the optimal value of the two-way partitioning problem, and is always at least as good as the lower bound (5.8) based on $\\lambda_{\\min }(W)$\n",
